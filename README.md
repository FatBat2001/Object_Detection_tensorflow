I. Project Idea:
-	A desktop application that can identifies some objects from an image, using Artificial Neural Networks based on classification model that classifies data set that covers objects which include pens, phone, cup, keyboard, notebook. However, identification problem can be broken down into multiple tasks, starting with object detection at order level then the object classification illustrated below: 

II. Main functionalities :
-	The software will be used to identify objects based on artificial neural network classification, which includes the following: Phone, Pen, Notebook, Cup, and Keyboard. 
-	The user will be prompted to insert an image of an object they would like to identify, and by using Object Detection the software will be outputting the object’s label, and coordinates of the object for the inserted image. Classifying the objects in the image. 

III. Similar applications in market:

 Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos 
 
Autonomous Driving. Self-driving cars depend on object detection to recognize pedestrians, traffic signs, other vehicles, and more. For example, Tesla’s Autopilot AI heavily utilizes object detection to perceive environmental and surrounding threats such as oncoming vehicles or obstacles. 
  
Animal detection in Agriculture. Object detection is used in agriculture for tasks such as counting, animal monitoring, and evaluation of the quality of agricultural products. Damaged produce can be detected while it is in processing using machine learning algorithms 

IV. Dataset used:

We captured some real-life images of the following objects to train the model. 
{pen, notebook, cup, keyboard, phone} 
 

V. Details of the algorithm(s)/approach(es)

The Algorithms we use:  

•	Artificial neural networks (ANN) 

•	Convolution neural networks (CNN) 

- What are Artificial neural networks? 

•	The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. 

•	 Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes. 

- What is Convolution neural networks ? 

•	Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of neural networks that specializes in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. A digital image is a binary representation of visual data. It contains a series of pixels arranged in a grid-like fashion that contains pixel values to denote how bright and what colour each pixel should be.
